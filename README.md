# PlantDiseasesClassificationApp

The **PlantDiseasesClassificationApp** is a machine learning application designed to classify plant diseases using advanced models trained on image datasets.

The model was trained on the **Kaggle platform** using **GPU T4 x2** to ensure high performance and fast computations. The goal of this project is to provide an effective tool for plant disease detection, which can aid farmers and agricultural professionals in identifying plant health issues and taking timely actions.
